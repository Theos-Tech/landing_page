        <h3>THE WANDERGUIDE Project</h3>
        <p>WanderGuide is a travel application designed to help users effortlessly discover the hidden gems of the world, starting with New York and Los Angeles. The app aims to simplify the travel planning process and alleviate the overwhelm experienced by new travelers in unfamiliar cities. It provides users with detailed information on local attractions, events, transportation, and dining options, saving them time and effort by eliminating the need for extensive research and planning.</p>

      <section id="technologies">
        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL</li>
          <li>Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express.js</li>
          <li>Libraries: Bootstrap, jQuery, Redux, Leaflet, Axios, Firebase, Material-UI</li>
          <li>APIs: Google Maps, Yelp</li>

      <section id="challenges">
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The primary challenge addressed by WanderGuide is providing new travelers with a user-friendly and informative platform to plan their trips and navigate unfamiliar cities. The app aims to eliminate the confusion and overwhelm associated with travel planning by offering comprehensive information on local attractions, events, and dining options. However, it is important to note that the app cannot solve issues related to external factors that may affect a user's travel experience, such as weather conditions, language barriers, flight delays, or cancellations.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="risks">
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>Technical risks include data security and API dependence. To mitigate data security risks, the app will implement strong security measures such as encryption, regular security audits, and access control. API dependence poses a risk, as the app relies heavily on third-party APIs like Google Maps and Yelp. To address this, proper error handling and fallback mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the app can function even if one or more APIs are temporarily unavailable.</p>
        <p>Non-technical risks include user acquisition, market saturation, lack of user adoption, and unexpected changes in the travel industry. To mitigate these risks, extensive market research will be conducted, target audiences will be engaged, and the app's user experience will be continually improved based on user feedback.</p>

      <section id="infrastructure">
        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The development team will follow the GitHub flow for branching and merging in the project's repository. This ensures a structured approach to collaboration, with separate branches created for each feature or bug fix. The main branch will only be updated after thorough code review and testing.</p>
        <p>The deployment strategy involves using AWS cloud services to host the application and database. This allows for scalability and high availability. Continuous deployment will be implemented, using tools like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy to automate the build, test, and deployment process.</p>
        <p>Testing will be performed using automated tools such as Jest and Enzyme to ensure the app functions correctly across different browsers and devices. This approach catches and resolves bugs early in the development process, ensuring a reliable and stable application.</p>
