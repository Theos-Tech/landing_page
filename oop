  <section id="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The primary challenge addressed by WanderGuide is providing new travelers with a user-friendly and informative platform to plan their trips and navigate unfamiliar cities. The app aims to eliminate the confusion and overwhelm associated with travel planning by offering comprehensive information on local attractions, events, and dining options. However, it is important to note that the app cannot solve issues related to external factors that may affect a user's travel experience, such as weather conditions, language barriers, flight delays, or cancellations.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="risks">
    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>Technical risks include data security and API dependence. To mitigate data security risks, the app will implement strong security measures such as encryption, regular security audits, and access control. API dependence poses a risk, as the app relies heavily on third-party APIs like Google Maps and Yelp. To address this, proper error handling and fallback mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the app can function even if one or more APIs are temporarily unavailable.</p>
    <p>Non-technical risks include user acquisition, market saturation, lack of user adoption, and unexpected changes in the travel industry. To mitigate these risks, extensive market research will be conducted, target audiences will be engaged, and the app's user experience will be continually improved based on user feedback.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="infrastructure">
    <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>The development team will follow the GitHub flow for branching and merging in the project's repository. This ensures a structured approach to collaboration, with separate branches created for each feature or bug fix. The main branch will only be updated after thorough code review and testing.</p>
    <p>The deployment strategy involves using AWS cloud services to host the application and database. This allows for scalability and high availability. Continuous deployment will be implemented, using tools like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy to automate the build, test, and deployment process.</p>
    <p>Testing will be performed using automated tools such as Jest and Enzyme to ensure the app functions correctly across different browsers and devices. This approach catches and resolves bugs early in the development process, ensuring a reliable and user-friendly application.</p>

  <section id="existing-solutions">
    <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
    <p>Existing solutions in the travel domain include TripAdvisor, Yelp, and Google Maps. While they provide information on local attractions, events, and activities, WanderGuide differentiates itself in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Similarities:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>All solutions offer information on local attractions and user reviews.</li>
        <li>They have both mobile and web-based platforms.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Differences:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>WanderGuide focuses on personalized travel guides created by individual users, while TripAdvisor and Yelp primarily provide travel reviews and recommendations.</li>
        <li>Google Maps offers comprehensive mapping features, including real-time traffic updates and directions, while Yelp and TripAdvisor do not.</li>
        <li>The ability for users to create and share their own guides is unique to WanderGuide.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>By offering personalized travel guides, WanderGuide fills a gap in the market and provides a unique value proposition compared to existing solutions.</p>
